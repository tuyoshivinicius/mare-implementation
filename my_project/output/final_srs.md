## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to provide a detailed description of the functional and non-functional requirements of the 'my_project' task management system. This document is intended for use by the project team, including developers, testers, project managers, and other stakeholders.

### 1.2 Scope
'my_project' is a general software system designed to provide task management functionality for individuals or teams. The system allows users to create, categorize, update, and delete tasks, and provides administrators with the ability to view and manage all tasks. The system also provides performance, availability, and usability features to ensure a smooth user experience.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- Task: A unit of work to be completed.
- Project: A group of related tasks.
- User: An individual who uses the system to manage tasks.
- Administrator: A special type of user who can view and manage all tasks in the system.
- UI: User Interface.
- SRS: Software Requirements Specification.
- IEEE: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
- SUS: System Usability Scale.

### 1.4 References
- IEEE 830-1998: IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications.
- SUS: System Usability Scale.

### 1.5 Overview
The rest of this document includes the overall description of the system, detailed functional and non-functional requirements, external interface requirements, system models, and verification and validation methods. The appendices include a traceability matrix and a glossary of terms.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
'my_project' is a standalone system that does not depend on any other software systems. It is designed to be used on any modern web browser, and it interacts with a database to store and retrieve task data.

### 2.2 Product Functions
'my_project' provides the following main functionalities:
- Task creation, categorization, status update, and deletion.
- Task management for administrators.
- Fast and responsive system performance.
- High system availability (24/7).
- User-friendly and intuitive interface.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
There are two types of users for 'my_project':
- Primary Users (Employees): These users use the system to create, categorize, update, and delete tasks. They only have access to their own tasks.
- Administrators: These users have additional permissions to view and manage all tasks in the system. They can also edit tasks as necessary.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
'my_project' is a web-based application that can be accessed via modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. The system is hosted on a server and uses a database to store task data.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- The system must follow the IEEE 830 standard for SRS structure and content.
- The system should be designed with an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- The system must support multiple user roles with different permissions.

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
- It is assumed that users will have a basic understanding of how to use web-based applications.
- The system is dependent on a reliable internet connection for users to access and use the system.
